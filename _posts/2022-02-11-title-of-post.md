Call me Slug, that's it, don't need no acronyms.
Tryin' to keep the masochist tucked inside the pacifist.

But God it's gettin hard to give 'em passes when they act as if they came up on the south side of Nazareth. Can't imagine this, it's like a beauty pageant where them models project and serve the law of averageness. Coat hanger on the mic, rappin mannequins. Stash 'em out behind the garage, where the trash be in. Don't go and get mad, I ain't your daddy kid. And you not Ant, so why you tryin to sample this?
So pop your little titties out, ego expanding. Them shenanigans'll catch a free ride up in that ambulance
Can't fix them damages with bandages. Another midlife crisis, tryin to brag on all the ass you get. Cash it in and take a look at who you dancin' with. You just a middle man between the fiends and your management. Minneapolis, takes the passion with a twist of lemon, cause I'm on some old fashioned shit. So tell Anakin we lookin for Orlando with Coach and the "Champion", go fix a couple sandwiches.
