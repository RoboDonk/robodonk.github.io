Gently sores little helmet-man through the air, but less gentle will be his landing and consequent descent into the deep blue. A moment before he reclined at his utmost leisure, unaware of the fat man perched far above. He is catapulted by the Fat Man into the merciless jaws of gravity; the helmet may yet come in handy, then again, it may all be for naught.

Little Helmet Man will be sorely missed after he sinks away from home and memory, but the fish needed feeding, the need was dire, his sacrifice timely. He will be remembered fondly on every Fishie Friday cookout!
